			<p><strong>The vision of ConnectHER is to bring people throughout the world that are committed to informing and encouraging girls to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) through one on one mentorship.  
The goals of ConnectHER are to:</strong><br/>
1. Maximize access to mentorship with, and with public and private sector organizations and institutions interested in expanding girls’ participation in STEM.<br/>
2. Strengthen capacity of existing and evolving projects by sharing exemplary practice research and program models, outcomes, and products.<br/>
3. Use the leverage of a network and the collaboration of individual girl-serving STEM programs to create the tipping point for gender equity in STEM.<br/><br/>
<strong>Our platform’s focus is to:</strong><br/>
1. Strengthen the capacity of girl-serving STEM programs to effectively reach and serve underrepresented girls in STEM.<br/>
2. Increase the effectiveness of Collaboratives by providing professional development focused on sustainability, organizational effectiveness, and shared leadership.<br/>
3. Maximize K-12 school counselors' access to and use of relevant, high-quality resources that increase awareness of barriers to girls' interest and engagement in STEM.<br/><br/>
Exemplary practices in these areas are delivered using a variety of methods, including webinars, the project website, and included in the professional development forums and mini-grants throughout each Collaborative.
The organizations selected to host local Collaboratives are impressive in their knowledge, experience, and diversity. As a group, the local Collaboratives have an extensive network of organizations and individuals engaged in pursuing this common goal and the opportunity to share with and learn from each other. They vary in focus areas and populations served, and include higher education institutions, community-based organizations, and private non-profits, but all work to increase gender equity in STEM fields. Currently, 32 Collaboratives, serving 40 states, facilitate collaboration between 22,800 organizations who serve 16.35 million girls and 8.5 million boys.

The NGCP implements a tested, comprehensive program of change that uses collaboration to expand and strengthen STEM-related opportunities for girls and women. In each state, the NGCP model creates a network of professionals, researchers, and practitioners, facilitating collaboration and delivering high-quality research-based professional development.  We strengthen the capacity of projects by sharing research-based exemplary practices, program models, and products. We train and mentor participants to collaborate and create partnerships at the state and local level. Professional development is offered through webinars and face-to-face training. Participating programs can also receive mini-grant funding for collaborative STEM-focused projects. To date, over 37,579 participants have been served in 441 mini-grant projects, and over 28,434 practitioners have been served through in-person events and webinars.
